# Kali-Rehydrate

A simple bash script in the works. Inspired by: github.com/TheOPSECGuy

This script will pull in a number of git repos that are useful when we pentest, as well as installing packages that are used regularly.

This is an on-going build, Feel free to use this as a base and tweak it to your own prefrences/liking.

This requires Kali 2021.X +

For the specific way of testing, after the initial installation. We will download the Shellter ZIP file and extract it to the /opt/ file. From that point on the script should manage the rest. afterwards, we will need to make us a root user(kali-root-login), along with changing the password(sudo passwd). Downloading the remote connection tool will be the last step along with connecting/validating the tools should happen at the same time.
